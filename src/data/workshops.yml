  title: Runtime Permissions in practical use.
  descriptionInMd: Jedną z większych nowości szczególnie dla deweloperów z tegorocznego Google I/O było wprowadzenie stopniowych uprawnień (Runtime Permissions). Powoduje to że musimy (a raczej powinniśmy) sprawdzać je przed każdym użyciem a także być przygotowani na odmowę dostępu np. do kontaktów użytkownika. W tym warsztacie krótko omówimy Runtime Permissions, skupiając się na tym jak pisać na "stare" Androidy z użyciem nowych uprawnień, a następnie przejdziemy do kodowania przykładów sprawdzania uprawnień, prośby o dostęp do wybranych a także jak można to sobie uprościć. Wymaganiem jest posiadanie skonfigurowanego emulatora Android M lub telefonu z tą wersją Androida.

  title: Spring Boot & Cloud - showcase of T/BDD, Domain Driven Design, and distributed microservices - the easy way.
  descriptionInMd: >
    We’ll take a simple set of requirements, and build a Spring app using TDD/    BDD, but with modeling based on aggregate roots and bounded contexts from DDD. Then we will turn this into a distributed system, with microservices, using some of the Spring Cloud tools.


    This partially live coding session is aimed at people for whom Spring Boot, Cloud, DDD and microservices are new. There’ll be no rocket science, instead we will talk about and explain all the steps, to understand what’s the difference between the old style of modeling, and how DDD brings us to microservices. We will look at what Spring has to offer for our case, and hopefully, we will see, that while microservices are much more difficult on operation side, they are not that hard in normal development, even on a small scale[*].


    (* Don’t do microservices on a small scale though. This architecture is for solving problems emerging from Conway’s Law, so if you don’t have them, or do not expect to have them, don’t touch microservices)


    Difficulty level: basic Java knowledge
    Requirements: if you want to hack around: JDK8, IDE, Gradle, Git. If you want just to look&listen - nothing.

First we'll simply connect multiple nodes in a cluster, but then we'll add Persistence in order to make our systems resilient against failure. We'll also talk about distributed systems and partitions in general and learn to understand and make the right trade-offs when designing distributed applications. All this will be implemented as part of a simple demo-application we'll be working together on as a group (each contributing a node in the cluster).

    When working with data you must:

    - Execute the code.


    The dplyr package makes each of these steps as fast and easy as possible by:


    - Elucidating the most common data manipulation operations, so that your options are helpfully constrained when thinking about how to tackle a problem.


    - Providing simple functions that correspond to the most common data manipulation verbs, so that you can easily translate your thoughts into code.


    - Using efficient data storage backends, so that you spend as little time waiting for the computer as possible.


    The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the basic tools that dplyr provides, and show how you to apply them to data frames.

    Difficult conversations cannot be avoided. More important is what you would do then. In most cases we tend to use two strategies: being agressive so that we can protect what is important for us or being passive to not worsen the situation. It rarely works. You need another way.


    We will discuss and practice particular technique that will help you to

    - have more understanding of your own and others needs

    - use language that will not unnecessarily rise emotional response

    - have more undersanding of your own and others motivation

    - define your borders not attacking others

    If you find anything curious about it or just want to learn a little bit, come to the workshop.

  title: Developer Tools Ecosystem
  descriptionInMd: >
    The IT systems has become more and more complex. Fortunately we have now a set of utilities and tools that helps us in the development process. Project management (Jira, Jira Agile, Redmine), collaboration platforms (Confluence, Wiki), build (Continuous Integration and Delivery) systems (Jenkins, Travis, Bamboo, Team City), source code management (GIThub, BitBucket, Stash, Gitlab) and quality (Sonar, Clover, PMD, Checkstyle, Sputnik, Findbugs, JaCoCo) has become a standard part of our workflow. Here's a talk on how to connect the dots and set up the development tools ecosystem. Moreover we will cover GIT Flow in depth.


    Please bring your laptop with Vagrant (>= 1.7) and Virtualbox (>= 4.3) installed. Preferred machine with at least 2 CPU Core and more than 4 GB of RAM.

  title: How TypeScript saved web application
  descriptionInMd: >
    JavaScript sucks.


    Even though it’s the best language to make your first “HelloWorld” example in matter of seconds, it makes it really hard to create or maintain large applications without lots of silly errors and hours of debugging.


    After 2 years of struggle with a quite large front-end app made in JavaScript (ES5) and wounds gained from CoffeeScript I found a path of hope. The path cobbled with types, function literals and classes.


    Verily I say unto you, follow the path of TypeScript.

  title: Microservices - enough with theory, let's code some
  descriptionInMd: >
    We have been on many talks about the (not so) new software design approach which is - "Microservices".


    Having organized few Microservice Hackathons (both public and internal) and developing applications for the last 7 months using that approach, we would like to show you what are the BUTs of the idea. Rarely can you hear about the challenges and issues related to this architectural approach and we’ll tell nothing but the truth about it. Also we’ll show how you can quickly start creating your own apps using the tools we have created at 4finance / SoftwareMill.


    Just a glimpse of what will you see in action: zookeeper for service discovery; Kibana / Graphana for monitoring; client code in Java and Groovy; Ansible for provisioning. And the best part is that everything is opensourced and ready to use.


    Expect nothing but live coding and may the Demo Gods have mercy on us ;-)

  title: Reactive Cloud - leverage AWS Lambda & AWS API Gateway to develop event-driven, serverless solutions
  descriptionInMd: >
    Let's build a fast, reactive application harnessing the power of Java and AWS Lambda. Then publish, maintain and monitor its API via AWS API Gateway. During our hands-on workshop we will check how AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway services work in practice by implementing AWS Lambda Functions written in Java and then deploying them into the real AWS Cloud environment followed by exposing and publishing their API through AWS API Gateway as RESTful web-services.


    As a bonus for (active!) workshop attendees I will hand out a number of coupons of $25-value for further experiments with AWS Cloud services.

  title: How to develop applications for disabled people using PISAK libraries
  descriptionInMd: PISAK is an open-source, mainly Python platform for disabled people. It allows them to communicate and  entertain themselves by using a singular input (puffing, clicking, moving a muscle) or free-choice (eyetracker or headtracker). Easy to use, highly customisable, with a library that allows to fast prototype an application suitable for a disabled person in a couple of hours. You can check out the code at [Github](https://github.com/BrainTech/pisak) and read more about the project at [PISAK](http://pisak.org/)

  title: User Story Mapping: Backlog Evolved
  descriptionInMd: >
    Come to learn what User Story was intended to be and why it should rather be told than written down. You'll practice User Story Mapping, a technique that helps to build a shared understanding between business stakeholders and delivery team. This results in smoother and faster collaboration.


    By visualising activities and tasks your users try to complete it's much easier to link your efforts in software development with their jobs & needs. Visualising releases and their goals helps to cut down scope and focus on most important things first.


    During the workshop, you'll take part in a simulated User Story Mapping workshop. You'll learn how to use the technique to plan releases, cut down scope and build better understanding between all project participants.

  title: Searching for answers in dumps
  descriptionInMd: >
    I'd like to show how to read thread and heap dumps.


    Nothing fancy, rather for beginners, however I noticed that not everybody can:


    - find simple and more tangled deadlocks looking at stacktraces

    - do rough profiling just by using jstack

    - see where memory leaks by analyzing heap dump

    - and similar stuff


    And of course - how to retrieve them ;)


    No special experience or equipment is required, just basic Java knowledge and laptop

  title: Add types - reduce bugs. Transition from Javascript to TypeScript.
  descriptionInMd: >
    TypeScript is continuously gaining popularity and recognition in recent years, with Angular 2 using TypeScript being an important manifestation of the trend. Its advantages, such as static type checking and possibilities of better code structuring, have been appreciated by developers and proved to significantly reduce the amount of bugs.


    During the workshop, we’ll introduce you to the dead-simple TypeScript syntax, show its main strong points working in practice and create a small AngularJS app.


    Next, we’ll cover the main architectural challenges in AngularJS and show how TypeScript aids to overcome them. Last but not least, we’ll refactor an existing application (using external libraries) in order to gradually introduce types and use TypeScript capabilities to full extent.

  title: Data marketing
  descriptionInMd: >
    Munging and analyzing data is loads of fun, especially when you communicate with people who understand you - quants, researchers, analysts, programmers. But usually they are not the decision makers. And when it comes to selling data, nobody will care about your beautiful analyses and visualizations, they will most probably want just one number.


    The workshop is about choosing the first right number (the one that is demanded from you) and selling other ideas (the ones they should demand) to decision makers. It's based on WHO-approach of evidence briefs for policy and my two-years experience as a quant in public administration.
